                    I’m definitely not an evil person. I’m a human. I make mistakes like everyone. But I’m not evil.
                    When I came to 89 I
                    came from server 30. Server 30 was run by one alliance. They took everything they wanted and burned
                    anyone who got their
                    way. When I became R5 the only thing I ever wanted was to have a unified server where the top
                    alliance supported the
                    server as a whole. I tried to always be fair to everyone regardless of how strong they were or how
                    big their alliance
                    is. And I do understand that did not always make everyone happy, fair is still fair. You should not
                    have special
                    privileges, or be treated wrong just because you don’t spend as much money as the next person.</p>

                    I honestly believe at this point, people are continuing to blame me because they don't want to face
                    what they have done.
                    While my system did not make everyone happy all the time it kept the game fair. It served the
                    greatest good. When the
                    attempts were made to take me down, and an essence take down the system I have built, it left the
                    server in chaos. Those
                    people who are responsible for the rumors and the hatefulness used to take me down now. Do not want
                    to take
                    responsibility for the fact that not only did their actions. Remove me. It also created chaos on the
                    server. It's easier
                    to blame someone else than it is to take responsibility. Kinda reminds me of what happens in
                    American news. It's a
                    distraction technique. If they keep you looking over here, you're not going to look at them. Let's
                    take for example what
                    has happened with the fishing holes. I have heard from several people, that I am being blamed for
                    Krak taking 89 level
                    3. I am not in leadership in my alliance. I have no say so in what fishing holes we go after. I go
                    where I'm told just
                    like everyone else. I believe them blaming me so they don't have to take the responsibility and look
                    at themselves and
                    why we were able to take it. The server doesn't work together. They don't try to help each other.
                    But by putting the
                    blame on me, it distracts people from looking at the leadership of server 89. At this point, I am
                    nothing more than
                    scapegoat for them. A distraction technique.</p>

                  <p class="blog__excerpt" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000" data-aos-delay="800">When I say
                    what they have done, I mean the whole taking me out of “power”. Or at least that’s where it started.
                    See what
                    I ran RLHN and the nap. It was a job for me. I logged on every day around seven. And I logged off
                    every night around 1
                    AM. I would spend my entire day dealing with server issues. Talking to the other R fives. Developing
                    plans for upcoming
                    wars and versus events. And when I was president, I was handing out buffs. Talking to people on the
                    server to discuss
                    their issues and what they would like to see happen. It was Work. Unfortunately, some people saw it
                    as power. And they
                    wanted that power for themselves. So when I left RLHN, and was voted out of nap. No one picked up my
                    work. The answer
                    became let them work it out. Oh they’ll be fine. The system that kept our server united and working
                    as one team slowly
                    fell apart. Alliance started turning on each other. People started quitting. Everything just fell
                    apart. This game is
                    designed as a community strategy game. That’s why we have alliances, and states, and clusters. You
                    have to work with
                    your alliance, then you have to work with your state, then you have to work within your cluster.
                    When it becomes about
                    one person and their wants the system becomes defective. You have to play the game as a group or you
                    are doomed to fail.</p>

                      you do wrong? That sounds like it was all on purpose.</p>

                  <p class="blog__excerpt" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000" data-aos-delay="800">I think my
                    biggest regret, and my biggest mistake was putting my trust in the wrong person. I had a person on
                    this game
                    that was my right hand, like my sister. I trusted her with everything. If I was having a frustrating
                    day, I vented it to
                    her. I ran every plan past her. I shared with her everything that was happening in other alliances.
                    Then one day I get a
                    message from someone else that I trust to not trust her. And I didn’t wanna believe it. And then
                    someone else reached
                    out to me and sent me screenshots of a private room she had created in order to turn people against
                    me. And I still
                    didn’t wanna believe it. Then I got a call on discord frantically telling me that it wasn’t them
                    that this was her plan.
                    And I still didn’t wanna believe it. It made me question everything that I had said to her and
                    everything that she had
                    told me. But even after all of that, I still didn’t want to let go with my friend. It wasn’t until I
                    found out she was
                    the one who started the vote to remove me from the nap. Even though she knew exactly why I did what
                    I did. She had seen
                    the screenshots that it caused me to attack that player that day. And she used that to get rid of
                    me. She basically took
                    everything that I told her and twisted it against me. That was when I knew it was time for me to
                    leave this server and I
                    reached out to Pepe to take me in. Over the next two months after that happened, I watched. I
                    listened. And I heard all
                    the things that she was saying about me. I watched as everyone turned against me. The same people
                    that I had helped many
                    times. The same people that I had listened to when they were having a bad day. The same people I had
                    defended multiple
                    times. All turned on me.</p>

                    honestly, I know,
                    even if you write this article, it will fall on a lot of deaf ears. Because she is really good at

                  <p class="blog__excerpt" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000" data-aos-delay="800">There was a
                    private room created on discord by her. The people that were invited to that room were people that
                    had ever
                    expressed a complaint. For example, when I versus day was only on our server. The nap would vote on
                    the rules of that
                    day. And of course, some people were unhappy with that vote. Like they wanted an all out battle, but
                    the Nat had voted
                    to only attack your opponent. So what you had an essence was a bunch of people that maybe had simple
                    complaints that
                    could’ve been discussed all in a room together feeding off of each other. Now much later, I did ask
                    her about this room.
                    She claimed it was only so people would discuss their complaints in there and not in alliance chat.
                    The biggest issue
                    with her explanation is, if I am not told about these issues, I can never resolve them therefore,
                    how can the room be of
                    any benefit to the alliance? So now we have a room of people complaining to each other and feeding
                    off each other’s
                    anger. And no one addressing or trying to resolve any of it.</p>

                      room was for letting people express complaints, then how or why it's used to turn against you?</p>
                  </strong>

                  <p class="blog__excerpt" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000" data-aos-delay="800">Because the
                    room was kept a complete secret for me. As an R5, if my people have issues, I need to know so I can
                    address
                    them or at least explain the situation to them. When people are unhappy with something a lot of
                    times, you can resolve
                    it with a simple conversation. Because this room was kept a secret from me. I was never able to talk
                    to these people.
                    Didn’t know they had complaints. So now you got a room of say 10 people complaining about decisions
                    that I’ve made or
                    decisions the server has made. Now they’re all talking to each other and feeding off of each other’s
                    anger. Which makes
                    me the bad guy. Then Spicy Jo lead that conversation too. We should leave. And they did leave, just
                    not all the people
                    they thought was going to go with them went. I don’t remember the exact number, but it was about 5
                    to 7 people that
                    left. The reason why only that many left was because of the screenshots I received. I didn’t have
                    the entire
                    conversation of what happened there, but I had enough bits and pieces to be able to address one or
                    two of the complaints
                    that people had without letting on that I knew about the room.</p>

                  <p class="blog__excerpt" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000" data-aos-delay="800">That would
                    be a lot to go back through. I talked to her about everything. Yes there were many plans that helped
                    me
                    rework. She proofread all my presidential announcement. She reviewed every battle plan. She was in
                    the nap. I would have
                    to analyze everything that was said and done. The only thing that stands out in my mind right now,
                    where there were some
                    conversations in a nap where I felt uneasy about the way she was leading the conversation. But I
                    completely trusted her.
                    She basically handled the nap while I slept. That's how much trust I had in her.</p>

                    many a day thinking this went over to the moment that this all went left. It happened with the last
                    flower
                    event. The entire server., every alliance sent me flowers. It was probably one of the sweetest and
                    most wonderful things
                    that has happened while playing this game. It made me feel like all the work that I put into this
                    server was actually
                    appreciated. Unfortunately, the server did not show that love to her. Now she told me repeatedly
                    that she didn’t care
                    but the next thing I know she has started a competition in the alliance of who could send the most
                    flowers. The winner
                    of that contest would be granted the name king of roses. And of course, this is a competitive game
                    with competitive
                    people. A bunch of the guys jumped on it and started sending her flowers immediately. These guys
                    spent hundreds on
                    flowers to win that title. Hoop, knighty, and Rotor (BigD) went all out. Rotor won, and Knighty
                    started spending like a
                    madman to become the most powerful on the server. We all joked that he was doing it to impress her.
                    Because everyone
                    knew he had a big crush on her. So if I honestly had to put it on one moment, that competition would
                    be that moment.</p>

                    left the alliance. Her first attempt to tear apart the alliance did not work. When she left only a
                    few
                    followed. And one of those came back to me. She became R5 Inx, then she became an R4 in BROO, then
                    she became R5 of WSS.

                  <p class="blog__excerpt" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000" data-aos-delay="800">No, no no. I
                    think the flower event created a jealousy. From what I was told by others, her goal was to be in
                    control of
                    the strongest alliance and the server. And technically, she basically accomplished that. And what
                    did she do with it?
                    She ran the NAP, even when she was just an R four in WSS. And here is my point. It is under her
                    leadership that the
                    server fell. But you never hear about that. All you hear about is how it’s my fault when I have no
                    say on the server,
                    thanks to her vote to keep me out. Now let me throw in a disclaimer because I know this is gonna
                    come up. As I said
                    before I talk to her about everything and I vented to her. So have I talked shit about other R5s, or
                    R4s. Yes I have.
                    Because sometimes you just gotta get your frustrations out. And I have definitely said some, not so
                    nice things about
                    people, but it was said out of frustration and it was said in a place where I thought it was
                    confidential.</p>

                    </p>
                  </strong>

                  <p class="blog__excerpt" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000" data-aos-delay="800">First of
                    all, it was not the whole server. Adame was a guy in my alliance who wanted to be an R4. He was very
                    helpful
                    and I was definitely considering making him one. Unfortunately, there were a lot of rumors around
                    him that he had done
                    stuff and said stuff. And honestly, I didn’t know if it was true or not so I was basically watching
                    him to see if he
                    could be trusted. So why all this is going on I find out that he’s created a room in the game and
                    invited everyone that
                    is level 30 except for myself and the other 30s in my alliance that are loyal to me to this room. I
                    literally woke up
                    too five different people sending me screenshots of this room that he had created. Where he is
                    discussing with these 30s
                    that he wants to create a super alliance that can compete with RLHN. So I immediately went to him.
                    And of course he
                    immediately goes to the room and start saying she knows she knows. Little did he know they were
                    sending me screenshots
                    of every word said in that room. So I let him know that all these people that he’s trying to get to
                    create this super
                    alliance are my friends and they’re telling me of everything he saying. Of course he then gives me a
                    story that he was
                    only trying to bring all the 30s together first and then he was going to bring me in later and have
                    me lead the
                    alliance. He had no idea that I had already seen that he was talking to TQL about using their
                    alliance as the new super
                    alliance. When I showed him the screenshots of everything I had, he came clean he apologized and he
                    begged me for my
                    forgiveness. At this point, I’m like no he will never be an R4. But I’ll give him a second chance.
                    He accepted this or
                    at least I thought he accepted this. On the day we did capital. I found out he had been messaging
                    R5s, telling them that
                    if they make him an R4, he will bring all the strong players from RLHN with him. NSTR accepted his
                    offer, and Aeyd went
                    with him. I immediately went to nap, and I let them know that this guy had betrayed my alliance not
                    once, but now twice,
                    and that I was going to burn him. Georgie told me that he was her member now and that she would
                    defend him. So he got
                    burned, Georgie got burned, and anyone else that got involved got burned. Creed was a side swipe,
                    because the
                    disrespectful way he had been speaking to me a nap. Kyoubou burned them. After I burned Adame, I
                    said I quit, and he
                    took my phone and burned the rest of them. So basically four or five people got burned that day.
                    This is when Joe jumped
                    into action and had me banned from the nap. I basically gave her everything she wanted. And what did
                    she do with it?
                    Well, we all see the state of 89 now.</p>

                    the leader of NSTR, she later changed her name to King Princess. And if you still don’t know who she
                    is, she
                    was that girl that was always in world chat, saying inappropriate stuff to any man who would listen.
                    I ain’t never seen
                    one woman flirt so much in my damn life. And I swear I think I’ve seen more of her boobs that I have
                    on my own. The
                    Major, betrayal with her is, I always protected that alliance. That was the deal that I made with
                    Aeyd. He no longer
                    wanted to be leader, but he wanted to make sure that alliance was always protected. So I did
                    everything I could to
                    protect them. I even sent them members to help them take cities when they couldn’t take them
                    themselves. I made deals
                    with other alliances to give them cities. So it was like a double stab in the back. So yeah, I
                    snapped. I felt like
                    Julius Caesar getting stabbed by my own friends</p>

                    friends and
                    he was at my place that day for capital. So he was literally there looking me in my face seeing the
                    pain and hurt that I
                    was feeling from the betrayal and when I put my phone down and said I quit, he picked it up and said
                    are you sure you
                    quit and I said yeah fuck them. And he proceeded to burn the other four people. He zeroed King
                    Princess, he hit hoop,
                    one time for interfering, he zeroed Adame again, then he went and hit Creed. He hit creed because he
                    was the admin of
                    the nap discord. So he had seen every conversation and every disrespectful remark creed had made to
                    every woman in
                    there. He didn’t like him very much. Also, I would like to address the fact that people have said
                    that I made racist
                    comments toward Aeyd. When I called him a fake Muslim. First, I have very close friends that are
                    Muslims. I actually
                    know a good bit about the religion. And I do know what the principles are. Me calling him a fake
                    Muslim was me saying
                    that he is not being true to the religion that he likes to throw around that he is be so proud to be
                    a member of. When
                    all of this happened with him, I was fasting with him as part of Ramadan. Because I support my
                    members. For him to then
                    turn around and stab me in my back was just too much. I never meant any disrespect to any Muslims. I
                    respect all
                    religions. Everybody was persecuting me for that, but isn’t it kind of ironic that the Indonesians
                    followed me to my new
                    alliance? They are all Muslims and they know the respect that I showed them and their religious
                    beliefs.

                      event, what happened to you and everyone involved?</p>
                  </strong>

                  <p class="blog__excerpt" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000" data-aos-delay="800">So after all
                    of that happened and I calm down, I decided I was not going to let these people run me off. Rotor
                    decided
                    he was going to keep R5. Sassy was on a tirade because I didn’t make her R5. And the only reason why
                    I didn’t was
                    because she wasn’t online and she has a temper. I felt in that moment the alliance needed someone
                    calm to lead them
                    until I resumed leadership. Well that never happened. Kyoubou form a small alliance, and we all
                    joined that. Then I
                    remembered that Joe had destroyed BROO but the alliance was still sitting there as a farm alliance.
                    So I messaged Lenny
                    and I asked her if we could join. She said yes, and then she informed me of how badly they were
                    being treated in TQL and
                    wanted to know if I would be interested in rebuilding the alliance. I told her yes. Now why all this
                    is going on rogue
                    is begging the nap to let me join them. Of course Joe said no. Rogue intern said they would take me
                    in even without the
                    naps approval. I declined their offer because honestly, I love rogue and I love their members and I
                    didn’t want to put
                    them in danger. They had worked so hard to get into the nap on their own and I would not take that
                    from them. So we
                    stood BROO back up. Brought a lot of old members back to the alliance. And the Indonesian from RLHN
                    and from other
                    alliances came there too. That put us back into the top 10. The nap refused to let us back in, even
                    though we had earned
                    our position. They informed Lenny that she would have to get rid of me. She refused because I had
                    helped her rebuild.
                    The alliance was targeted every day. We continuously got hit, but we continuously grew. I guess once
                    they got tired of
                    hitting us and they realize we weren’t going anywhere we were allowed back into the nap. With the
                    caveat that I was not
                    allowed to speak in nap chat. Now true to what Maxi says, he did try to get me back into the nap.
                    The problem was his
                    girlfriend didn’t want me there. Whenever I asked her about it, she would say let me check on it. I
                    guess she didn’t
                    realize everything that was being said in nap chat was being told to me. So yes, the alliance was
                    allowed in, but I was
                    still banned from the chat. I can only assume that she was afraid that if I came back in there, I
                    might take back over.</p>

                    It’s nice here. Much less drama on the server as a whole and in the alliance. Pepe gives clear
                    instructions
                    on what we are doing and what is expected of us. The atmosphere is friendly, and people are always
                    willing to help each
                    other. The server as a whole works together. It’s great.</p>
